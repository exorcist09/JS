//JavaScript code is compiled 
--> The compiler checks the code before even executing 
the first line of code, if compiler finds any mistake it will give an error 



## Compilation Phase

==> Tokenizing /Lexing
--> the whole code is broken into small portion known as token.

==>Parsing
--> That token are understood and AST(Abstract Syntax Tree) is formed.

==>Code Generation
--> From that AST a executable code is formed.



## Compilation phase is done
--> Early error checking must be made == The compiler checks the code before even executing 
the first line of code, if compiler finds any mistake it will give an error 
--> A proper scope for varible must be made


##Code Execuation Phase
--> to execute code a execution context is created and that execution context  is known as 
GLobal Execution context

##Global Execution Context  is created as
==> Creation Phase ==  any variable will be made and will point to undefined, and this values is fixed as window in browser

==>Code execution Phase
